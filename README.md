# hello

## A few things about me:

* 📛 My name is Ayush Shrivastava.
* 🎂 I am fifteen years old.
* 😁 My pronouns are he/him.
* 🤔 I like to program and learn how everyday technology works in my free time.
* 💻 My [friend](https://github.com/henry-lang) and my brother played a big part in getting me to enjoy computers so much.

I am still very much a beginner though. I started teaching myself Python in early 2020, and I still have a ways to go before I could call myself experienced.
Still, since starting I have:

1. ⌨ Learned the fundamentals of programming
2. 🐍 Learned Python and Javascript (vanilla JS and Node.js)
3. 🖥️ [Learned the fundamentals of web development](https://github.com/henry-lang/soundbites)
4. ✔️ [Worked with APIs](https://github.com/ayush-shrivastava003/discord-bot)
5. 💻 Become more comfortable with interacting with computers and their operating systems (Windows 10, MacOS, Ubuntu)
6. 🏆 [Participated in a local hackathon](https://github.com/henry-lang/focus)

I'm looking to learn more about Java, C#, C/C++, and Rust. In addition I am hoping to learn to get better at optimizing and refining my code to be as efficient as possible.

## What do I do besides programming?

* 🎮 I like to play video games (currently I play Celeste, CS:GO, Microsoft Flight Simulator, and a bunch of others)
* 🎸 Play the guitar
* 🎵 [Listen to music](https://open.spotify.com/user/tzlftm1ovs5zdwsr80rj2hgpz)
* 🐕 Play with my dog
* 🚲 Bike around my neighborhood

ok that's all
